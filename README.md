## not really faq

### isnt this against the discord tos
yes - which is why this is a private repository \
also this project uses the undocumented user account
gateway instead of the bot gateway \
as a [wise diety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Dz3TRNdbY)
once said, "its not a crime if you dont get caught"

### arent there tons of other selfbot tools out there
no those are all just rats lol \
or they use some completely outdated bot account gateway
